## Hi, I'm Rebecca!

I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Carleton University, pursuing a cybersecurity specialization as well as minors in both math and English. These days, I'm particularly interested in cryptography (classical crypto, quantum crypto, as well as PQC), approximation algorithms (especially those with data science applications), and optimization problems.

I currently volunteer with the Carleton Computer Science Society as a publications contributor. Previously, I was the Co-President of the Carleton Cybersecurity Club (2023-24) and represented Canada at the International Cybersecurity Challenge (2023). In my free time, I maintain a [blog](https://blog.rkempe.ca/).

## Some Recent Projects, Talks, etc
### Why does Theory Matter in Computer Science? (Talk, Blog Posts)
A talk I did for the [Carleton Computer Science Society Tech Talk Night](https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2024-2025/2024-11-19-tech-talk-night/) on November 19th, 2024. It aims to explain the importance of abstraction and generalization in computer science (and more broadly in problem solving), and how we can apply theory and/or math to solve real-world problems.

This presentation was intended to be self-contained and accessible to an audience of second year computer science students. I have also adapted the content of the talk into a series of blog posts, for anyone who was interested but could not attend.

### Hypergraphs, Approximation Algorithms, and the Densest Subgraph Problem (Guest Lecture)
A guest lecture I did for the first year discrete structures course (COMP 1805) at Carleton University, in June 2024. This talk was intended to expose the students to how the math they were learning could be applied in other contexts, and serve as an introduction to the research I was doing under the supervision of Dr. Yuly Billig. A huge thank you goes out to Dr. Alexa Sharp for giving me the opportunity to lecture to her class! I also talked a bit about undergraduate research opportunities and how the research process felt.

### How To Be a ‚ÄúTalentless Hack‚Äù in Public (Talk + Zine)
A talk I did for the [Carleton Computer Science Society Tech Talk Night](https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2023-03-01-tech-talk-night/) on March 1st, 2023. It is about imposter syndrome, its ramifications, and techniques for preventing imposter syndrome from taking over and ruining your life. I also converted this presentation into a blog post and a zine!
