## Hi, I'm Rebecca!

I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at Carleton University, pursuing a cybersecurity specialization as well as minors in both math and English. These days, I'm particularly interested in cryptography (classical crypto, quantum crypto, as well as PQC), approximation algorithms (especially those with data science applications), and optimization problems.

I currently volunteer with the Carleton Computer Science Society as a publications contributor. Previously, I was the Co-President of the Carleton Cybersecurity Club (2023-24) and represented Canada at the International Cybersecurity Challenge (2023). In my free time, I maintain a [blog](https://blog.rkempe.ca/).

## Some Recent Projects, Talks, etc
### Why does Theory Matter in Computer Science? (Talk, Blog Posts)
A talk I did for the [Carleton Computer Science Society Tech Talk Night](https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2024-2025/2024-11-19-tech-talk-night/) on November 19th, 2024. It aims to explain the importance of abstraction and generalization in computer science (and more broadly in problem solving), and how we can apply theory and/or math to solve real-world problems.

The first section is quite general; it is an overview of what we actually mean when we talk about ‚Äútheory‚Äù, as well as a discussion about abstraction and generalization, which I see as being two fundamental ideas in computer science. The rest of the talk is a little bit more technical in nature ‚Äì it goes over some real-world problems that can be reduced to the densest subgraph problem, and discusses some algorithms for solving the problem, and looks at some generalizations of the densest subgraph problem. 

This presentation was intended to be self-contained and accessible to an audience of second year computer science students. I am also adapting the content of the talk into a series of blog posts, for anyone who is interested but could not attend.

### Supermodularity, Iterative Peeling, and Densest Subgraphs (Course Project)
This is a report and presentation I prepared for [COMP 5112: Algorithms for Data Science](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~maheshwa/courses/5112/F24/5112-F24.html) at Carleton University. The aim was to break down and understand a recent paper by Chekuri, Quanrud, and Torres called [Densest Subgraph: Supermodularity, Iterative Peeling, and Flow](https://chekuri.cs.illinois.edu/papers/densest-subgraph-soda22.pdf) which studies the densest subgraph problem through the lens of supermodular set functions. The report covers a (very brief) introduction to the theory of submodular functions and gives extended presentations of some of the ideas in the original paper.

### Hypergraphs, Approximation Algorithms, and the Densest Subgraph Problem (Guest Lecture)
A guest lecture I did for the first year discrete structures course (COMP 1805) at Carleton University, in June 2024. This talk was intended to expose the students to how the math they were learning could be applied in other contexts, and serve as an introduction to the research I was doing under the supervision of Dr. Yuly Billig. A huge thank you goes out to Dr. Alexa Sharp for giving me the opportunity to lecture to her class! I also talked a bit about undergraduate research opportunities and how the research process felt.

### Circuits, Parallelism, and Quantum Advantage (Course Project)
This is a report and presentation I prepared for COMP/MATH 4803: Computable Functions at Carleton University. The aim was to introduce the paper [Quantum Advantage with Shallow Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00690) by Bravyi, Gosset, and K√∂nig. Because this was a computability theory course and most of the class did not have a background in quantum computing, my goal was to bring the class up to speed on concepts required to understand the paper and give a sketch of the results, their significance, and an idea of why they are true.

### How To Be a ‚ÄúTalentless Hack‚Äù in Public (Talk + Zine)
A talk I did for the [Carleton Computer Science Society Tech Talk Night](https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2022-2023/2023-03-01-tech-talk-night/) on March 1st, 2023. It is about imposter syndrome, its ramifications, and techniques for preventing imposter syndrome from taking over and ruining your life. I also converted this presentation into a blog post and a zine!
